spotify-title
===============
this is a thing that uses wmctrl to fetch the title of the first spotify window it finds, writing it to a file of your choosing, made for my own usage for showing song titles when streaming.

Usage
-------

    # to write to file at ~/spotify-now-playing and loop continously
    ./spotify-title --loop ~/spotify-now-playing
